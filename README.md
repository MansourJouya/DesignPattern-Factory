# Design Patterns - Factory

This repository contains implementations of the Factory design pattern in various programming languages. The Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

## Introduction

The Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that abstracts the instantiation process of objects. It defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful when the creation process is complex or when a class should be able to create objects without being tied to specific classes.

### What is Factory?

The Factory pattern falls under the category of **Creational Patterns**. Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The Factory pattern is especially useful when you want to delegate the responsibility of creating objects to a separate class, thus promoting loose coupling in your code.

## Languages Included

- C#
- C++
- Python
- JavaScript
- VB.NET
- F#

Each language has its own directory containing the specific implementation of the Factory pattern.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansourJouya/DesignPattern-Factory.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPattern-Factory
```

You can then explore the implementation in your preferred programming language.

## Usage

1. Choose the language implementation you want to work with.
2. Follow the instructions in each language's directory for running the example code.
3. Observe how the Factory pattern is applied and how it provides a way to create objects.

### Example (C#)

In C#, the Factory pattern is implemented in the `ProductFactory.cs` file. To run the example, ensure you have .NET installed and execute the following commands:

```bash
dotnet run
```
